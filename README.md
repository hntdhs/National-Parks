The National Park Database is an app that allows a user to browse through every park in the US National Park system, taking data from the official API of the NPS. It features descriptions and a variety of information for each park, such as fee information, listings for campsites plus links to make reservations, relevant articles, and plenty more. 

Users can sign up for an account, see all the parks on the main page after logging in, click on any park for information about that particular park, and save parks to their collection of favorite parks, as well as a seperate collection of parks they have visited.

The primary tools used to create the app were Python 3.9.7, Flask 1.0.2, SQLAlchemy 1.4.39, and Jinja 2.10. A full list of dependencies can be found in the requirements.txt file.

The app has been deployed at Heroku at https://npdb.herokuapp.com/.
